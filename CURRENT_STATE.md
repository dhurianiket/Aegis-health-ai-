# CURRENT_STATE.md — Verified Production Snapshot

## Live Status: Production System is Stable

### What is Currently Built & Deployed
- **Frontend App:** Fully built using React 18, Vite, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. Next.js and Firebase App Hosting are completely removed/not used.
- **Landing Page:** The landing page is successfully hosted as the main entry point to the web application. Navigation is fully synced.
- **Authentication Flow:** Login flow correctly routes authenticated Google Sign-in users from the landing page straight to the `/dashboard` without infinite redirect loops. Protected routes prevent unauthenticated access. Refreshing the dashboard keeps users authenticated.
- **Firebase Functions (Backend):** Webhooks (such as `julesWebhook` and `paperclipJulesCoordinator`) are implemented natively as structured Firebase Cloud Functions inside the `/functions/` directory using standard `firebase-functions/v2/https`. Next.js API routes are not used.
- **Public & Static Pages:** Static informational pages (How It Works, Security, blog posts) exist safely alongside the web application with a unified Aegis brand design.
- **Build Checks:** Strict `npx tsc --noEmit` and Vite compilation passes cleanly. Linting is stable.

### What is Still Pending / In Progress
- Refinement of AI response schemas for specialized medical edge cases.
- Continuous scaling of Jules VM webhook handlers to support more diverse autonomous orchestration commands.

---

### Recent Deployments & Changes
- **Google Jules Autonomous Integration:** Webhook triggers and Cloud Functions deployed inside `/functions/` to enable autonomous VM staging.
- **Login Redirect Fix:** `AuthContext.tsx` was hardened to respect `onAuthStateChanged` persistence correctly, preventing the system from prematurely throwing logged-in users back to the landing page and bypassing incorrect redirect traps.
- **React 310 Loop Fix:** Suppressed render loop race conditions by strict state dependency management.
- **Landing Page Revisions:** Cleaned up marketing copy to speak plainly and support Indian patient-demographics.
- **Dependency Cleanups:** Aligned all module resolutions to ensure Firebase Admin, Firebase Functions, and Vite dependencies coexist perfectly.

### Current Version Status
- **Stack:** React + Vite + TypeScript
- **State:** Verified and Operational
- **Deployment Strategy:** Firebase Hosting (Frontend) + Firebase Cloud Functions (Backend)
